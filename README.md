# SVG practice
## by Kevin Boyle 5/4/18

### Description
This page is practice for creating and interacting with SVG images

#### Known Bugs
SVGs are not responsive yet... the page works best at full screenwidth, however the main image does have an interesting burial effect when the page is condensed.

#### Tutorials
The animated cat section is based on a tutorial, the other images are original creations

#### Original works are copyright of _Kevin Boyle_
